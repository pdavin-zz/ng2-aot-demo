# ng2-aot-demo

This is an Angular 2 AoT demo app used to demonstrate AoT problems. 

Gulp drives the build, and the Angular ngc compiler is invoked directly to do the AoT compilation.

Rollup is used to do bundling.

Setup: npm i; gulp --type aot ngc

The code is a fork of https://github.com/ibqn/ng2-heroes-gulp
